This is the end of this short book on the Angular Router. We have learned a lot. We looked at what routers do in general: they are responsible for manage state transitions. Then we looked at the Angular2 router: its mental model, its API, and the design principles behind it. We also learned how to test applications using the router, and how to configure it.

### Example App

Throughout the book I used the same application in all the examples. You can find the source code of this application here: [MailApp](https://github.com/vsavkin/router_mailapp).
