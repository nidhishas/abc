# Example

For all the examples in this book we will use MailApp, which is an application akin to Inbox or Gmail. At launch, the application displays a list of conversations, which we can browse through. Once we click on a conversation, we can see all its messages. We can also compose a new message, or view an existing message in a popup.

You can find the source code of the MailApp application here: [MailApp](https://github.com/vsavkin/router_mailapp).
